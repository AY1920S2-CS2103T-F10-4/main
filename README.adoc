* Mod Manager is for *NUS students* who prefer to use a desktop app for managing tasks for modules in a semester.
* It is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
* It can get your management of tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps, if you can type fast.
