== PROJECT: Mod Manager

---

== Overview

*Mod Manager* is a desktop application that assists NUS students
in *managing tasks, schedules, and contacts for their modules in a semester*.
Our team, which consists of five software developers,
took over an existing desktop Java application
https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s2.github.io/addressbook-level3/[Address Book (Level 3)]
with about 6 KLoC and evolve it into our *Mod Manager* with more than 10 KLoC.
The project spans over a period of eight weeks, where each of us
idealise and design the product, utilise CI/CD for weekly project enhancements,
implement features and functionality, write documentation (User Guide & Developer Guide),
as well as take part in Quality Assurance.

Technologies: Java, JavaFx, GitHub, Intellij IDEA

The following sections document all the contributions that I have made to *Mod Manager*.

== Summary of contributions

* *Code contributed*:
I personally contributed more than 3 KLoC to Mod Manager. All my code contributions
can be found https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/#search=dinhnhobao&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2020-02-14&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=false&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=dinhnhobao&tabRepo=AY1920S2-CS2103T-F10-4%2Fmain%5Bmaster%5D[here].

* *Major enhancement*: idealise and design the `Task` component of Mod Manager. The `Task`
component allows NUS students to manage their tasks, such as programming assignments, homework,
tutorials, reviewing lecture content, exam revision for their respective modules in a semester.

** What it does: every `Task` has a description, a time frame (for example, `13/04/2020 23:59`),
and a `Module` it belongs to. It allows users to organise and manage their tasks easier, with
commands such as CRUD, mark the task as completed, view uncompleted tasks,
view tasks by `Module`, find `Task` by its description, and search for a `Task` by its date,
month, or year.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because every NUS student
has a lot of things to do in the semester, and `Task` management offers a way for them
to plan, and manage their tasks better. The `Task` component blends in well with `Mod Manager`
and its other components, for example, every `Task` is allocated to an academic `Module`
.
** Highlights: The implementation of the project is tedious. It required a great amount of effort to understand the original https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3[AddressBook (Level 3)]
code given in order to morph and build upon this original project. Every small increment in the `Task` features require changes to multiple
existing parts of the code, which requires using debugging tools and tracing the code to understand the code execution sequence.
For example, with a small change in the `Task` class design, multiple `JUnit` test cases and data `Storage` design
need to be changed. The `Task` component also has some dependencies on other components, as well as multiple other components
have dependencies on the `Task` component. This requires good communication skills between the team
to notify each other every time the high-level design of `Task` or other components change, even
with just a slight change. The `Task` component also required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives,
which lead to incremental changes over the period of the project. For the commands implemented,
input validation and data formatting is critical to avoid unexpected behaviours to our application.

** Credits: The idea is adapted from https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3[AddressBook (Level 3)]
and https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S2/duke[the Duke project]

* *Minor enhancement*: design and implement the UI to represent a `Task`. The design inspired
other components of *Mod Manager* to adapt a similar presentation.

Dark red color indicates a task that is not yet done.

== Contributions to the User Guide
|===
|_Given below are sections I contributed to the User Guide.
They comprise most of the commands for the `Task` component.
They showcase my ability to write documentation targeting end-users._
|===
NOTE: For your easier understanding of the content below, every `Task` in a `Module` has an `ID`,
which uniquely identifies the task in the module. The `ID` is important for us to differentiate a task
from the others in the `Module`, since two `Task` s may have the same description and time frame.
The `Task` component uses Singapore's standard date format (`dd/MM/yyyy`).

I also contributed to some sessions of the User Guide for the entire Mod Manager.

== Contributions to the Developer Guide

|===
|I idealise and design the `Task` component of *Mod Manager*. I implemented most of the commands
for this `Task` component, the remaining are CRUD commands which are based on my initiated `Task` design.

Given below are sections I contributed to the Developer Guide. They showcase my ability to write technical documentation and the technical depth of my contributions to the project._
