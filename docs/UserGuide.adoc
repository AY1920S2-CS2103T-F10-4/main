== Introduction

Mod Manager is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing tasks for modules in a semester*. More importantly, Mod Manager is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Mod Manager can get your management of tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

=== Installing ModManager

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `modmanager.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Mod Manager.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
+
Here are some example commands that you can try:

* *`command all`* : lists all available commands in our Mod Manager.
* *`mod add /code CS2103T /desc Software Engineering`* : start by adding our module CS2103T to our module list.
* *`facil add /name Akshay Narayan /email dcsaksh@nus.edu.sg /code CS2103T`*: adds our Lecturer information to the module. If you are rushing to write an e-mail to our Lecturer, you can refer to this at [...] conveniently.
* *`task add /code CS2103T /task Complete tP tasks`*: adds a task to our CS2103T module
* *`task add /code CS2103T /task Improve the DG`*: adds another task to our CS2103T module
* *`task find /upcoming`*: finds upcoming tasks. You should see the two tasks above right here.
* *`exit`* : exits the application

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

=== Using ModManager
This section offers an overview of ModManager's layout so that you can find what you need easily.

There are three main areas in ModManager:

. A __task bar with all the module codes__ at the top of the screen
. A __command box__ and __result display box__ at the bottom of the screen
. A __dashboard__ that occupies most of the screen, which tells you the module code and name,
facilitators' information, classes information, and tasks or deadlines that you need to complete.

The *_taskbar_* at the top of the screen lists all of the modules that you are taking this semester.
Clicking in one of these tabs will lead you to the section related to that module.

The *_command box_* is the area for you to enter commands. The result of each command will be shown
in the *_result display box_*, immediately below the command box.

The *_dashboard_* shows all the contents and task for your module. It contains information about
the module, facilitators' information, classes information, and tasks or deadlines that you need to complete.
