== Introduction

// tag::introduction[]
Welcome to *Mod Manager*!

*Mod Manager* is a desktop application that assists students in *managing schedules and contacts for their modules* in a semester.

More importantly, *Mod Manager* is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

If you can type fast, Mod Manager can get your management of schedules and contacts done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== About

// tag::about[]
This user guide helps you to master how to use Mod Manager.
It explains the features and commands supported by Mod Manager, with examples to illustrate how the application works.

+
Here are some example commands that you can try:

* *`cmd all`* : lists all available commands in our Mod Manager.
* *`mod add /code CS2103T /desc Software Engineering`* : adds the module CS2103T to the module list.
* *`class add /code CS2103T /type LEC /at FRIDAY 14:00 16:00 /venue i3-Aud`* : adds a class to the module CS2103T.
* *`task add /code CS2103T /desc Complete tP tasks`*: adds a task to the module CS2103T.
* *`facil add /name Akshay Narayan /email dcsaksh@nus.edu.sg /code CS2103T`*: adds a facilitator to the module CS2103T. If you are rushing to write an e-mail to your lecturer, you can refer to this conveniently.
* *`cal view /week this`* : views your schedules for the current week.
* *`exit`* : exits the application.

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

=== Using Mod Manager
This section offers an overview of Mod Manager's layout so that you can find what you need easily.

There are two main areas in Mod Manager:

. A __result display box__ and __command box__ at the bottom of the screen.
. A __main viewing area__ that occupies most of the screen.

The *_command box_* is the area for you to enter commands. The result of each command will be shown
in the *_result display box_*, immediately above the command box.

.The result display box and command box
image::commandAndResultBox.png[]

The *_main viewing area_* shows all the contents for one of the four tabs at any point in time.
The four tabs are **Module**, **Facilitators**, **Tasks** and **Calendar**

* **Module** tab contains information about lessons, tasks and facilitators for a particular module.
It also shows the list of modules you currently have.

****

==== Marking a task as done

Marks a task as done in the module.

With this command, you can find tasks that contain any of the given keywords in their description.

Format: `*task* find DESCRIPTION [MORE_DESCRIPTIONS]...`

Parameter constraints:
****
* The search works across modules, and no `/code` commands are required. For example, you may want to find all the `assignment` currently due.
* If no descriptions are supplied, no tasks will be found.
* Search for description is case insensitive. e.g `programming` will match `Programming`.
* The order of the descriptions does not matter. e.g. `Programming Assignment` will match `Assignment Programming`.
* Tasks are only searched in the description.
* Words can be partially matched e.g. `A` will match `Assignment`.
* Tasks matching at least one description will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `assign home` will return both `Programming Assignment 2` and `Homework 3`.
****

==== Searching tasks by date

Searches all tasks that occur on your specified date, month, or year.

Format: `*task* search [/day DAY] [/month MONTH] [/year YEAR]`

Example: `*task* search /month 4`, `*task* search /day 10 /month 4`

Parameter constraints:
****
* The search works across modules, and no `/code` commands are required.
* Tasks are only searched for its date. Tasks that do not have dates or times
will not be found in this list.
* If no optional fields are provided, the Mod Manager's behaviour is the same as `*task* list`.
* An invalid day, month, or year number can be provided, e.g.
`/day 32`, `/month 13`, `year -1`, however, no matching tasks
will be returned by the search. On the other hand, Invalid inputs such as
`/day monday`, `/month December`, `/year this year` are not allowed,
and you will have to follow the input requirements using valid numbers for
`/day`, `/month`, and `/year` instead.
* Tasks matching all conditions will be returned (i.e. `AND` search). e.g. `/day 10 /month 4` will
match only tasks that are on 10 April in any year.
****

==== Editing a task

From here on, you will be introduced to Mod Manager's task ID system.
****
* A task can be uniquely identified in the system by two things: its associated module and a 3-digit number.
* A complete task ID will consist of two elements: `MOD_CODE` and `ID_NUMBER`.
* Examples of valid task ID: `CS2103T 848`, `CS4231 132`.
* You can find out a task's ID by looking at the general task list - can be viewed with `*task* list`
(section 4.4.3) , or the task list of a specific module - can be viewed with `*mod* view` (section 4.2.3).
****

You can edit a task's description, its date and time details, or both.

Format: `*task* edit MOD_CODE ID_NUMBER [/desc DESCRIPTION] [/on DATE] [/at TIME]`

Mod Manager will find the task associated with the task ID number provided and update the information correspondingly.

Example: `*task* edit CS2103T 848 /desc UG submission /on 12/04/2020 /at 23:59`

Since you may want to remove the date and time of a task, Mod Manager provides you a way to do so.

Format: `*task* edit MOD_CODE ID_NUMBER [/desc DESCRIPTION] /on non`

Example: `*task* edit CS2103T 848 /on non`
