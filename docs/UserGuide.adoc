== Introduction

Mod Manager is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing tasks for modules in a semester*.
More importantly, Mod Manager is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, Mod Manager can get your management of tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

=== Installing Mod Manager

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `modmanager.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Mod Manager.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
+
Here are some example commands that you can try:

* *`cmd all`* : lists all available commands in our Mod Manager.
* *`mod add /code CS2103T /desc Software Engineering`* : adds our module CS2103T to our module list.
* *`facil add /name Akshay Narayan /email dcsaksh@nus.edu.sg /code CS2103T`*: adds our Lecturer information to the module. If you are rushing to write an e-mail to our Lecturer, you can refer to this conveniently.
* *`task add /code CS2103T /task Complete tP tasks`*: adds a task to our CS2103T module.
* *`task add /code CS2103T /task Improve the DG`*: adds another task to our CS2103T module.
* *`task find /upcoming`*: finds upcoming tasks. You should see the two tasks above right here.
* *`exit`* : exits the application.

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

=== Using Mod Manager
This section offers an overview of Mod Manager's layout so that you can find what you need easily.

There are two main areas in Mod Manager:

. A __command box__ and __result display box__ at the bottom of the screen.
. A __main viewing area__ that occupies most of the screen.

The *_command box_* is the area for you to enter commands. The result of each command will be shown
in the *_result display box_*, immediately above the command box.

.The command box and result display box
image::commandAndResultBox.png[]

The *_main viewing area_* shows all the contents for one of the four tabs at any point in time.
The four tabs are **Module**, **Facilitators**, **Tasks** and **Calendar**

* **Module** tab contains information about lessons, tasks and facilitators for a particular module.
It also shows the list of modules you currently have.
+
