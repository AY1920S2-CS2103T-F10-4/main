== Introduction

Welcome to *Mod Manager*!

*Mod Manager* is a desktop application that assists students in *managing schedules and contacts for their modules* in a semester.

More importantly, *Mod Manager* is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

If you can type fast, Mod Manager can get your management of schedules and contacts done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== About

This user guide helps you to master how to use Mod Manager.
It explains the features and commands supported by Mod Manager, with examples to illustrate how the application works.

== Quick Start

=== Installing Mod Manager
Here are the steps to get you started with using Mod Manager:

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `modmanager.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Mod Manager.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
+
Here are some example commands that you can try:

* *`cmd all`* : lists all available commands in our Mod Manager.
* *`mod add /code CS2103T /desc Software Engineering`* : adds the module CS2103T to the module list.
* *`class add /code CS2103T /type LEC /at FRIDAY 14:00 16:00 /venue i3-Aud`* : adds a class to the module CS2103T.
* *`task add /code CS2103T /task Complete tP tasks`*: adds a task to the module CS2103T.
* *`facil add /name Akshay Narayan /email dcsaksh@nus.edu.sg /code CS2103T`*: adds a facilitator to the module CS2103T. If you are rushing to write an e-mail to your lecturer, you can refer to this conveniently.
* *`cal view /week this`* : views your schedules for the current week.
* *`exit`* : exits the application.

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

=== Using Mod Manager
This section offers an overview of Mod Manager's layout so that you can find what you need easily.

There are two main areas in Mod Manager:

. A __result display box__ and __command box__ at the bottom of the screen.
. A __main viewing area__ that occupies most of the screen.

The *_command box_* is the area for you to enter commands. The result of each command will be shown
in the *_result display box_*, immediately above the command box.

.The result display box and command box
image::commandAndResultBox.png[]

The *_main viewing area_* shows all the contents for one of the four tabs at any point in time.
The four tabs are **Module**, **Facilitators**, **Tasks** and **Calendar**

* **Module** tab contains information about lessons, tasks and facilitators for a particular module.
It also shows the list of modules you currently have.

`/day 32`, `/month 13`, `year -1`, however, no matching tasks
will be returned by the search. On the other hand, Invalid inputs such as
`/day monday`, `/month December`, `/year this year` are not allowed,
and you will have to follow the input requirements using valid numbers for
`/day`, `/month`, and `/year` instead.
* Tasks matching all conditions will be returned (i.e. `AND` search). e.g. `/day 10 /month 4` will
match only tasks that are on 10 April in any year.
****

==== Finding upcoming tasks

Finds upcoming tasks.

Format: `*task* find /upcoming`

==== Editing a task

From here on, you will be introduced to Mod Manager's task ID system.
****
* A task can be uniquely identified in the system by two things: its associated module and a 3-digit number.
* A complete task ID will consist of two elements: `MOD_CODE` and `ID_NUMBER`.
* Examples of valid task ID: `CS2103T 848`, `CS4231 132`.
* You can find out a task's ID by looking at the general task list - can be viewed with `task list`
(section 4.4.3) , or the task list of a specific module - can be viewed with `mod view` (section 4.2.3).
****

You can edit a task's description, its date and time details, or both.

Format: `*task* edit MOD_CODE ID_NUMBER [/desc DESCRIPTION] [/on DATE] [/at TIME]`

Mod Manager will find the task associated with the task ID number provided and update the information correspondingly.

Example: `*task* edit CS2103T 848 /desc UG submission /on 12/04/2020 /at 23:59`

Since you may want to remove the date and time of a task, Mod Manager provides you a way to do so.

Format: `*task* edit MOD_CODE ID_NUMBER [/desc DESCRIPTION] /on non`

Example: `*task* edit CS2103T 848 /on non`

==== Deleting a task
