== Introduction

Mod Manager is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing tasks for modules in a semester*. More importantly, Mod Manager is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Mod Manager can get your management of tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!
