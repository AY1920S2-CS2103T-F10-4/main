== Introduction

=== Purpose
This document describes the architecture and system design of Mod Manager.

=== Audience
The developer guide is for software developers, designers and testers who wants to understand the architecture and system design of Mod Manager.

== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a facilitator).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram1.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Mod Manager data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Module feature
The module feature manages the modules in Mod Manager and is represented by the `Module` class.
A module has a `ModuleCode` and an optional `Description`.

It supports the following operations:

* add - Adds a module to Mod Manager.
* list - Lists all modules in Mod Manager.
* view - View information of a module in Mod Manager.
* edit - Edits a module in Mod Manager.
* delete - Deletes a module in Mod Manager.

==== Implementation

===== Adding a module
The add module feature allows users to add a module to Mod Manager.
This feature is facilitated by `ModuleCommandParser`, `ModuleAddCommandParser` and `ModuleAddCommand`.
The operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#addModule()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the module add mechanism behaves at each step:

1. The user executes the module add command and provides the module code and description of the module to be added.
2. `ModuleAddCommandParser` creates a new `Module` based on the module code and description.
3. `ModuleAddCommandParser` creates a new `ModuleAddCommand` based on the module.
4. `LogicManager` executes the `ModuleAddCommand`.
5. `ModManager` adds the module to the `UniqueModuleList`.
6. `ModelManager` updates the `filteredModules` in `ModelManager`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the module add command works:

.Sequence diagram for `mod add` command
image::ModuleAddSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `ModuleCommandParser`, `ModuleAddCommandParser` and `ModuleAddCommand` should end at
the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a module add command:

.Activity diagram for `mod add` command
image::ModuleAddActivityDiagram.png[]

===== Listing all modules
The list module feature allows users to list all modules in Mod Manager.
This feature is facilitated by `ModuleCommandParser` and `ModuleListCommand`.
The operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#updateFilteredModuleList()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the module list mechanism behaves at each step:

1. The user executes the module list command.
2. `ModuleCommandParser` creates a new `ModuleListCommand`.
3. `LogicManager` executes the `ModuleListCommand`.
4. `ModelManager` updates the `filteredModules` in `ModelManager`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the module list command works:

.Sequence diagram for `mod list` command

NOTE: The lifeline for `ModuleCommandParser` and `ModuleListCommand` should end at
the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a module list command:

.Activity diagram for `mod list` command
image::ModuleListActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: Whether to support editing of module code
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Allow users to only edit the description of a module.
** Pros: Easier to implement.
** Cons: More rigid for users.
* **Alternative 2:** Allow users to edit the module code of a module.
** Pros: Provides more flexibility for users.
** Cons: Implementation is more complex as the classes, tasks and facilitators all store module codes and have to be edited too.

=== Facilitator feature
The facilitator feature manages the facilitators in Mod Manager and is represented by the `Facilitator` class.
A facilitator has a `Name`, an optional `Phone`, an optional `Email`, and optional `Office` and one or more `ModuleCode`.
A `Module` with the `ModuleCode` of the facilitator should exist in Mod Manager.

It supports the following operations:

* add - Adds a facilitator to Mod Manager.
* list - Lists all facilitators in Mod Manager.
* view - Finds a facilitator in Mod Manager by name.
* edit - Edits a facilitator in Mod Manager.
* delete - Deletes a facilitator in Mod Manager.

==== Implementation

===== Adding a facilitator
The add facilitator feature allows users to add a facilitator to Mod Manager.
This feature is facilitated by `FacilCommandParser`, `FacilAddCommandParser` and `FacilAddCommand`.
The operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#addFacilitator()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the facilitator add mechanism behaves at each step:

1. The user executes the facilitator add command and provides the name, phone, email, office and module code of the facilitator to be added.
2. `FacilitatorAddCommandParser` creates a new `Facilitator` based on the name, phone, email, office and module code.
3. `FacilitatorAddCommandParser` creates a new `FacilitatorAddCommand` based on the facilitator.
4. `LogicManager` executes the `FacilitatorAddCommand`.
5. `ModManager` adds the facilitator to the `UniqueFacilitatorList`.
6. `ModelManager` updates the `filteredFacilitators` in `ModelManager`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the facilitator add command works:

.Sequence diagram for `facil add` command

===== Finding facilitators
The find facilitator feature allows users to find a facilitator by name in Mod Manager.
This feature is facilitated by `FacilCommandParser`, `FacilFindCommandParser` and `FacilFindCommand`.
The operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#updateFilteredFacilitatorList()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the facilitator find mechanism behaves at each step:

1. The user executes the facilitator find command and provides the names of the facilitators to search for.
2. `FacilFindCommandParser` creates a new `FacilFindCommand` based on the names.
3. `LogicManager` executes the `FacilFindCommand`.
4. `ModelManager` updates the `filteredFacilitators` in `ModelManager`.

The operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#setFacilitator()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the facilitator edit mechanism behaves at each step:

1. The user executes the facilitator edit command and provides the index of the facilitator to be edited and the fields to be edited.
2. `FacilEditCommandParser` creates a new `EditFacilitatorDescriptor` with the fields to be edited.
3. `FacilEditCommandParser` creates a new `FacilEditCommand` based on the index and `EditFacilitatorDescriptor`.
4. `LogicManager` executes the `FacilEditCommand`.
5. `FacilEditCommand` retrieves the facilitator to be edited.
6. `FacilEditCommand` creates a new `Facilitator`.
7. `ModManager` sets the existing facilitator to the new facilitator in the `UniqueFacilitatorList`.
8. `ModelManager` updates the `filteredFacilitators` in `ModelManager`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the facilitator edits command works:

===== Deleting a facilitator
The delete facilitator feature allows users to delete a facilitator from Mod Manager.
This feature is facilitated by `FacilCommandParser`, `FacilDeleteCommandParser` and `FacilDeleteCommand`.
The operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#deleteFacilitator()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the facilitator delete mechanism behaves at each step:

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a facilitator delete command:

.Activity diagram for `facil delete` command
image::FacilitatorDeleteActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: How the facilitator is edited
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a new facilitator with the edited fields and replace the existing facilitator with the new facilitator.
** Pros: Preserves the immutability of the `Facilitator` object.
** Cons: Overhead in creating a new `Facilitator` object for every edit operation.
* **Alternative 2:** Modify the existing facilitator directly.
** Pros: More convenient and lower overhead to edit a facilitator by setting the relevant fields without creating a new `Facilitator` object.
** Cons: The `Facilitator` object has to be mutable and may be edited unintentionally.

===== Aspect: How the facilitator list is stored
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store all facilitators in a single facilitator list.
** Pros: Will not have to maintain multiple lists. Less memory usage as each facilitator is represented once. Will not have to iterate through multiple lists to find all instances of a particular facilitator when executing facilitator commands.
** Cons: Have to iterate through the whole list to find facilitators for a particular module when executing module commands.
* **Alternative 2:** Store facilitators for each module in a separate list.
** Pros: Able to find facilitators for a particular module easily when executing module commands.
** Cons: May contain duplicates as some facilitators may have multiple module codes. Have to iterate through multiple lists when executing facilitator commands.

//tag::calendar[]
=== Calendar Feature
The calendar feature manages the calendar in Mod Manager and is represented by the Calendar class. A calendar has a LocalDate.

It supports the following operations:

* view - Views the schedules and tasks in a whole week in Mod Manager.
* find - Finds empty slots in a week from current day to end of the week in Mod Manager.

==== Implementation

===== Viewing the calendar
The view calendar feature allows users to view the calendar for a week in Mod Manager.
This feature is facilitated by `CalCommandParser`, `CalViewCommandParser` and `CalViewCommand`. The calendar is exposed in the `Model` interface in `Module#updateCalendar()` and it is retrieved in `MainWindow` to show the timeline for the specified week to users.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the calendar view mechanism behaves at each step:

1. The user executes the calendar view command and provides which week to be viewed. The week to be viewed can be this or next week.
2. `CalViewCommandParser` creates a new `Calendar` based on the specified week.
3. `CalViewCommandParser` creates a new `CalViewCommand` based on the `Calendar`.
4. `LogicManager` executes the `CalViewCommand`.
5. `ModelManager` updates the calendar in `ModelManager`.
6. `MainWindow` retrieves the calendar from `LogicManager` which retrieves from `ModelManager`.
7. `MainWindow` shows the calendar.

The following sequence diagram shows how the calendar view command works:

.Sequence diagram for `cal view` command
image::CalViewSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `CalCommandParser`, `CalViewCommandParser` and `CalViewCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of the diagram.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a calendar view command:

.Activity diagram for 'cal view command'
image::CalViewActivityDiagram.png[]

===== Finding empty slots in calendar
The find empty in calendar feature allows users to know the empty slots they have in the calendar from the current day to the end of the week in Mod Manager. This feature is facilitated by CalCommandParser, CalFindCommandParser and CalFindCommand.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the calendar find mechanism behaves at each step:

1. The user executes the calendar find command.
2. CalFindCommandParser creates a new CalFindCommand.
3. LogicManager executes the CalFindCommand.

The following sequence diagram shows how the calendar find command works:

.Sequence diagram for `cal find` command
image::CalFindSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for CalCommandParser, CalFindCommandParser and CalFindCommand should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of the diagram.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a calendar find command:

.Activity diagram for `cal find command`
image::CalFindActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: Calendar appearance
.New design for calendar appearance (alternative 1)
image::NewCalendar.png[]

.Old design for calendar appearnce (alternative 2)
image::OldCalendar.png[]

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Displaying the days of a week in calendar from left to right.
** Pros: The whole week can be seen on one screen without having users to scroll down for a particular day.
** Cons: Words that are long in number of characters may not be able to be displayed in a single line.
* **Alternative 2:** Displaying the days of a week in the calendar from top to bottom.
** Pros: Tasks and schedules that have description that are long can be displayed in a single line.
** Cons: There is a need for users to scroll down to see a particular day.
If there are many tasks and schedules in a day, the other days after it will be pushed downwards and this requires even more scrolling for users.

Alternative 1 is chosen as it is better that people are able to see their whole schedules and tasks for a week in one look.
It makes better use of space than alternative 2 where the right side is usually not used.

===== Aspect: Command syntax for calendar find command
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** User is required to input `cal find empty`.
** Pros: It is short in command length.
** Cons: Since there is only one type of calendar find, `empty` may seem redundant.
* **Alternative 2:** User is required to input `cal find /type empty`.
** Pros: With the need to input `/type`, it can be clear about the type of find the command is trying to do.
This is because without the `/type`, it is possible that users thought that the command is finding the word `empty`.
** Cons: It can be tedious for users to type `/type` and this increases the command length.

Alternative 1 is chosen because it is shorter than alternative 2 and hence it can be easier for users to type.
It is easier to implement too. The word `empty` is kept to allow users to know what the find command is for.


// tag::undoredo[]
=== [Proposed] Undo/Redo feature
==== Proposed Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th facilitator in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new facilitator. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the facilitator was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoState5.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations
// explain why alternative is chosen (e.g. Alternative 1 is chosen because of ease of implementation due to time constraint.)
===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the facilitator being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Instructions for Manual Testing

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

[NOTE]
These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on; testers are expected to do more _exploratory_ testing.

=== Launch and Shutdown

. Initial launch

.. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder
.. Double-click the jar file +
   Expected: Shows the <<gui, GUI>> with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.

. Saving window preferences

.. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.
.. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file. +
   Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

=== Deleting a facilitator

. Deleting a facilitator while all facilitators are listed

.. Prerequisites: List all facilitators using the `list` command. Multiple facilitators in the list.
.. Test case: `delete 1` +
   Expected: First contact is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.
.. Test case: `delete 0` +
   Expected: No facilitator is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.
.. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x` (where x is larger than the list size) _{give more}_ +
   Expected: Similar to previous.
