== Introduction

=== Purpose
This document describes the architecture and system design of Mod Manager.

=== Audience
The developer guide is for software developers, designers and testers who wants to understand the architecture and system design of Mod Manager.

== Setting Up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components generically interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `some command`.

.Component Interactions for `some command` Command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI Component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `HelpWindow`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic Component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `ModManagerParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a facilitator).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model Component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Mod Manager data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Facilitator>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage Component

// tag::storage[]
.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Mod Manager data in json format and read it back.
// end::storage[]

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common Classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Module Management Feature

// tag::module[]
// tag::mod[]
The module feature manages the modules in Mod Manager and is represented by the `Module` class.
A module has a `ModuleCode` and an optional `Description`.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Support for editing module code
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Allow users to edit the module code of a module.
** Pros: More flexibility for users.
** Cons: More complex implementation as the classes, tasks and facilitators all store module codes and have to be edited too.
* **Alternative 2:** Allow users to only edit the description of a module.
** Pros: Easier to implement.
** Cons: More rigid for users.

Alternative 1 is chosen as it gives users more flexibility and is more user-friendly.

** Pros: User types less.
** Cons: When user wants to edit one field only, user have to key in other unnecessary details.
* **Alternative 2:** Have one prefix each for `day`, `startTime` and `endTime` fields.
** Pros: Easier to parse and less invalid inputs to take note of. User can also edit any field.
** Cons: More prefixes to remember and command will be very lengthy.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How the optional attribute of `TaskDateTime` is managed
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Implement `Task` as an abstract class for Mod Manager.
A task with a specified time period will be created as a `ScheduledTask`, while a task with no
time period specified will be created as a `NonScheduledTask`, with both `ScheduledTask` and
`NonScheduledTask` are concrete subclasses of `Task`.
** Pros: Utilises Object-Oriented Programming. Easy to implement `*search*` functionality,
which we need to search for tasks that occur on a specified date, month, or year,
and `*upcoming*` functionality, which we need to find the upcoming tasks in Mod Manager.
For these two features, we only need to work on `ScheduledTask` instances, which reduces the
burden of checking for `null` `TaskDateTime` instances as the second approach below.
** Cons: More difficulty in implementation due to time constraints. Moreover, command
`*edit*` that allows us to edits the information of the task will be troublesome, when
a user decides to add a time period to a `NonScheduledTask`.
In this case, we have to re-create a new `ScheduledTask` with the same description and its time provided.
If we need to maintain a `List<ScheduledTask>` or `List<Task>` somewhere in the code, for example,
in our `Module` instance, we also have to update the list contents in our `Module` s too.
This requires the association between `Module` and `Task` to be bi-directional, which
increases content and data coupling and make it harder for us to maintain and conduct tests. There is also extra overhead time
communicating and collaborating with another member in our team who is doing the `Module` component, Because of these challenges,
we decide to weaken the association between `Task` and `Module`, which is elaborated in our next aspect.

* **Alternative 2:** Implement `Task` as a concrete class in Mod Manager. `Task` s without a specified time period
will have its `TaskDateTime` set to `null`, while `Task` s with a given time period will be assign a `TaskDateTime` attribute, which
is a wrapper class for Java's `LocalDateTime`.
** Pros: Easier to implement, as we only need to create one class `Task`.
** Cons: We must handle `null` cases every time we query something about the time of a `Task`.
For example, it's more challenging to implement the `*search*` and `*upcoming*` command, since we have to handle the cases when the `TaskDateTime` instance is `null`.
It's very complex to implement the method `compareTo` of `Comparable` interface for `Task` to compare the time between tasks,
when one, or both of the `TaskDateTime` attributes can be `null`.

===== Aspect: The association between `Module` and `Task`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Aggregation: Each `Task` can have an unique `ModuleCode` tag, which uniquely identifies which `Module` the task belongs to.
This is a aggregation relationship, which is weaker than composition in our second approach.

.Class Diagram: A `Task` acts as a container for `ModuleCode` object of a `Module`. `ModuleCode` objects can survive without a `Task` object.
image::ModuleTaskAggregationDiagram.png[]

** Pros: Easier to implementation, and weak coupling with `Module` implementation. The `Module` need not
to be aware that there are a list of `Task` s for it.
** Cons: The association between `Module` and `Task` cannot be extensive and fully descriptive as in
our second approach, but this is a trade-off given the time constraints.

* **Alternative 2:** Composition: each `Module` has a list of `Task` s corresponding to it.
If the `Module` is deleted, all of the related `Task` s for the `Module` will also be removed.

.Class Diagram: A `Module` consists of `Task` objects.
image::ModuleTaskCompositionDiagram.png[]

** Pros: This design choice better simulates the real-life interactions between `Module` and `Task`.
For example, if we drop a `Module` in NUS, we will also drop all the `Task` s related to the `Module`,
such as assignments, homework, term tests, and exams.
** Cons: Difficulty in implementation due to time constraints, as well as strong content and data coupling. More overhead in communicating
and collaborating with the team member responsible for the `Module` component, as mentioned above.

=== Facilitator Management Feature

// tag::facilitator[]
The facilitator feature manages the facilitators in Mod Manager and is represented by the `Facilitator` class.
A facilitator has a `Name`, an optional `Phone`, an optional `Email`, and optional `Office` and one or more `ModuleCode`.
A `Module` with the `ModuleCode` of the facilitator should exist in Mod Manager.

It supports the following operations:

* add - Adds a facilitator to Mod Manager.
* list - Lists all facilitators in Mod Manager.
* view - Finds a facilitator in Mod Manager by name.
* edit - Edits a facilitator in Mod Manager.
* delete - Deletes a facilitator in Mod Manager.

==== Implementation Details

===== Adding a facilitator
The add facilitator feature allows users to add a facilitator to Mod Manager.
This feature is facilitated by `FacilCommandParser`, `FacilAddCommandParser` and `FacilAddCommand`.
The operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#addFacilitator()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the facilitator add mechanism behaves at each step:

1. The user executes the facilitator add command and provides the name, phone, email, office and module code of the facilitator to be added.
2. `FacilitatorAddCommandParser` creates a new `Facilitator` based on the name, phone, email, office and module code.
3. `FacilitatorAddCommandParser` creates a new `FacilitatorAddCommand` based on the facilitator.
4. `LogicManager` executes the `FacilitatorAddCommand`.
5. `ModManager` adds the facilitator to the `UniqueFacilitatorList`.
6. `ModelManager` updates the `filteredFacilitators` in `ModelManager`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the facilitator add command works:

.Sequence Diagram for `facil add` Command

===== Editing a facilitator
The edit facilitator feature allows users to edit a facilitator from Mod Manager.
This feature is facilitated by `FacilCommandParser`, `FacilEditCommandParser` and `FacilEditCommand`.
The operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#setFacilitator()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the facilitator edit mechanism behaves at each step:

1. The user executes the facilitator edit command and provides the index or name of the facilitator to be edited and the fields to be edited.
2. `FacilEditCommandParser` creates a new `EditFacilitatorDescriptor` with the fields to be edited.
3. `FacilEditCommandParser` creates a new `FacilEditCommand` based on the index or name and `EditFacilitatorDescriptor`.

// tag::design-consideration-facilitator[]
==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Mutability of `Facilitator` object
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a new facilitator with the edited fields and replace the existing facilitator with the new facilitator.
** Pros: Preserves immutability of the `Facilitator` object.
** Cons: Overhead in creating a new `Facilitator` object for every edit operation.
* **Alternative 2:** Modify the existing facilitator directly.
** Pros: More convenient and lower overhead to edit a facilitator by setting the relevant fields without creating a new `Facilitator` object.
** Cons: Unintentional modification of the `Facilitator` object.

Alternative 1 is chosen to preserve the immutability of the Facilitator object to avoid unintentional modification.

===== Aspect: Storage of facilitators
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store all facilitators in a single facilitator list.
** Pros: Will not have to maintain multiple lists. Less memory usage as each facilitator is represented once. Will not have to iterate through multiple lists to find all instances of a particular facilitator when executing facilitator commands.
** Cons: Have to iterate through the whole list to find facilitators for a particular module when executing module commands.
* **Alternative 2:** Store facilitators for each module in a separate list.
** Pros: Able to find facilitators for a particular module easily when executing module commands.
** Cons: May contain duplicates as some facilitators may have multiple module codes. Have to iterate through multiple lists when executing facilitator commands.

Alternative 1 is chosen as the design is simpler without the need to maintain multiple lists and can also avoid duplicates in the storage.

===== Aspect: Reference of `ModuleCode` in `Facilitator` object
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a new `ModuleCode` object for each `Facilitator`.
** Pros: Easier to implement.
** Cons: Existence of multiple identical `ModuleCode` objects.
* **Alternative 2:** Reference each `Facilitator` to the `ModuleCode` in the `Module` list.
** Pros: Only require one `ModuleCode` object per unique `ModuleCode`. Can support editing of module codes more easily.
** Cons: Have to iterate through the module list to find the module code for the facilitator.

Alternative 1 is chosen because of ease of implementation due to time constraint.

//tag::calendar[]
=== Calendar Feature
The calendar feature manages the calendar in Mod Manager and is represented by the Calendar class. A calendar has a LocalDate.

It supports the following operations:

* view - Views the schedules and tasks in a whole week in Mod Manager.
* find - Finds empty slots in a week from current day to end of the week in Mod Manager.

==== Implementation Details

===== Viewing the calendar
The view calendar feature allows users to view the calendar for a week in Mod Manager.
This feature is facilitated by `CalCommandParser`, `CalViewCommandParser` and `CalViewCommand`. The calendar is exposed in the `Model` interface in `Module#updateCalendar()` and it is retrieved in `MainWindow` to show the timeline for the specified week to users.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the calendar view mechanism behaves at each step:

1. The user executes the calendar view command and provides which week to be viewed. The week to be viewed can be this or next week.
2. `CalViewCommandParser` creates a new `Calendar` based on the specified week.
3. `CalViewCommandParser` creates a new `CalViewCommand` based on the `Calendar`.
4. `LogicManager` executes the `CalViewCommand`.
5. `ModelManager` updates the calendar in `ModelManager`.
6. `MainWindow` retrieves the calendar from `LogicManager` which retrieves from `ModelManager`.
7. `MainWindow` shows the calendar.

The following sequence diagram shows how the calendar view command works:

.Sequence Diagram for `cal view` Command
image::CalViewSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `CalCommandParser`, `CalViewCommandParser` and `CalViewCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of the diagram.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a calendar view command:

.Activity Diagram for `cal view` Command
image::CalViewActivityDiagram.png[]

===== Finding empty slots in calendar
The find empty in calendar feature allows users to know the empty slots they have in the calendar from the current day to the end of the week in Mod Manager. This feature is facilitated by CalCommandParser, CalFindCommandParser and CalFindCommand.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the calendar find mechanism behaves at each step:

1. The user executes the calendar find command.
2. CalFindCommandParser creates a new CalFindCommand.
3. LogicManager executes the CalFindCommand.

The following sequence diagram shows how the calendar find command works:

.Sequence Diagram for `cal find` Command
image::CalFindSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for CalCommandParser, CalFindCommandParser and CalFindCommand should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of the diagram.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a calendar find command:

.Activity Diagram for `cal find` Command
image::CalFindActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Calendar appearance
.New Design for Calendar Appearance (Alternative 1)
image::NewCalendar.png[]


.Old Design for Calendar Appearance (Alternative 2)
image::OldCalendar.png[]

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Displaying the days of a week in calendar from left to right.
** Pros: The whole week can be seen on one screen without having users to scroll down for a particular day.
** Cons: Words that are long in number of characters may not be able to be displayed in a single line.
* **Alternative 2:** Displaying the days of a week in the calendar from top to bottom.
** Pros: Tasks and schedules that have description that are long can be displayed in a single line.
** Cons: There is a need for users to scroll down to see a particular day.
If there are many tasks and schedules in a day, the other days after it will be pushed downwards and this requires even more scrolling for users.

Alternative 1 is chosen as it is better that people are able to see their whole schedules and tasks for a week in one look.
It makes better use of space than alternative 2 where the right side is usually not used.

===== Aspect: Command syntax for calendar find command
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** User is required to input `cal find empty`.
** Pros: It is short in command length.
** Cons: Since there is only one type of calendar find, `empty` may seem redundant.
* **Alternative 2:** User is required to input `cal find /type empty`.
** Pros: With the need to input `/type`, it can be clear about the type of find the command is trying to do.
This is because without the `/type`, it is possible that users thought that the command is finding the word `empty`.
** Cons: It can be tedious for users to type `/type` and this increases the command length.

Alternative 1 is chosen because it is shorter than alternative 2 and hence it can be easier for users to type.
It is easier to implement too. The word `empty` is kept to allow users to know what the find command is for.
//end::calendar[]
=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
